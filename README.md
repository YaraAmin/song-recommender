## Dataset: Million songs :http://millionsongdataset.com/
## Methodology:
Popularity model - In this model, the new songs are recommended to a user based on the popularity of songs. This model is not the best one we can use since it has a hard drawback of always recommending the most popular songs to all the users. Hence most of the songs that any users are recommended to be the same.

Personalized model - In this model, the news songs are recommended using the users history and the genre's he likes. This model, thus has a very big advantage over the previous model that it will recommend songs based on a users choice and not the popularity of the songs. Hence curse of popularity is diminished to 0.
